# BIO312- Extra Credit

## _This is a complilation of all the commands I used to do my analysis of NP_008999.2 aka DNA meiotic recombinase 1 (DMC1)_

### Finding homologs with BLAST KEY ; this was done in Lab 3 for me
_the main goal of this lab is to find and align gene family homologs using NP_008999.2_ 
to make a new directory in lab03-s2-clee: 
> cd from globins to return back to home
> cd labs/lab03-s2-clee/ ; to go into lab03
> mkdir ~/labs/lab03-s2-clee/recombinases ; to make new directory folder
> cd ~/labs/lab03-s2-clee/recombinases/ ; go into new folder "recombinases"
> pwd ; check where you are
