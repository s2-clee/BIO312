## This is a complilation of all the commands I used to do my analysis of NP_008999.2 aka DNA meiotic recombinase 1 (DMC1)

### Finding homologs with BLAST KEY ; this was done in Lab 3 for me
; the main goal of this lab is to find and align gene family homologs using NP_008999.2
; to make a new directory in lab03-s2-clee: 
1. cd from globins to return back to home
2. cd labs/lab03-s2-clee/ ; to go into lab03
3. mkdir ~/labs/lab03-s2-clee/recombinases ; to make new directory folder
4. cd ~/labs/lab03-s2-clee/recombinases/ ; go into new folder "recombinases"
5. pwd ; check where you are
